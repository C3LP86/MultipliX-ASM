# Description

This project implements a simple calculator in x86 assembler that allows the user to multiply two integers.
The program uses system calls to interact with the user by displaying messages and reading input. 
It converts the entered strings to integers, performs the multiplication, then converts the result to a string for display.

# Features
- User Input: Asks the user to enter two integers (A and B).
- Multiplication: Performs multiplication of the two values.
- Display result: Displays the result of the multiplication in the console.

# Use
- Compilation: Uses an assembler such as NASM to assemble the code.
- Execution: Runs the program to enter the values ​​and get the result.

```
Enter a value for A : 5
Enter a value for B : 6
Result : 30
```
